# AI + History Collaboratory

### An online forum for historians exploring how artificial intelligence can enhance historical research — from handwritten text recognition to skills, workflows, database interfaces and beyond.

### We meet monthly online (4 pm UK time) and collaborate asynchronously via this GitHub organisation. Our three core strands are LLM-enabled handwritten text recognition, development of skills and workflows for historical research, and conceptualisation and integration of Model Context Protocol servers into historical research workflows.
